    <h1> How much pain will people withstand for M and Ms?</h1>
    <h2> Data Collection </h2>
    <p> To collect data we first asked around 46 people to stick their hand in 0 degree celcius water and for every 10 seconds in the <br>
     water, we gave them an m and m. We found that on average, people where able to have their hand in the icewater for 176.556 seconds.<br>
     Our next test was wall sits. Every twenty seconds people lasted, we gave them an m and m. We found that on average they lasted 250 seconds
    Finnally, we did planks. Every twenty seconds we gave them an m and m. We found that on average they lasted 102 seconds. </p>
    <h2> Data analysis </h2>
    <p>When we where testing the people putting their hands in icewater, we found that on average they lasted 176.556 seconds before the 10 seconds more was not worth the m and m.<br>
    When we where testing people on wall sits, we found that on average people lasted until 150 seconds in until 20 more seconds was not worth an m and m.<br>
    When we where testing people on planks, we found that people lasted an average of 102 seconds until an m and m was not worth 20 more seconds in pain.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>    We found out that most of the people got more m and ms from putting their hands in ice cold<br>
   water than from doing wall sits. This was partly caused by the fact that you got an m and ms every 10<br>
   seconds for putting your hand in ice water, and an m and ms for every 20 seconds you kept a wall sit.

   <h2> Analysis </h2>
  <p>TThrough analyzing the data we have collected we have noticed two things.
The first graph shows that over the years poverty has decreased for all races, although hispanic people are experiencing a rise in poverty.
The second graph that the poverty rate is highest for blacks and hispanics, and lowest for asians and whites.
We chose to represent the second graph in a pie chart to show proportionally how the races compare in terms of poverty rate.
This shows that people growing up in poverty are more likely to be in poverty themselves.
Our final visual displays the difference in the percentage of people in poverty according to their race. The photos of the man are proportional to each other. </p>
   
   <h2> conclusion </h2>
    <p>Throughout this project, we have learned many things. We have learned about how race affects how much money you make,
and how to chose how to display data. We discovered that line graphs are usually best when their is a time component, and pie charts when its proportional.
We have also learned through researching our topic the school to prison pipeline and have realized how lucky we are to go to a school like minnetonka.
